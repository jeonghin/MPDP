# Malaysian Political Dynamics Predictor (MPDP)
## Overview
The Malaysian Political Dynamics Predictor (MPDP) is a data-driven project designed to analyze and predict key aspects of the Malaysian political landscape. This project primarily focuses on forecasting party-switching behavior among politicians, identifying influential figures in such transitions, and projecting potential coalition formations. It leverages historical election data, political affiliations, and other relevant political events from the 2020–2022 Malaysian political crisis.

## Background
The 2020–2022 Malaysian political crisis, marked by significant party shifts, coalition government collapses, and the rapid succession of prime ministers, presents a complex political landscape for analysis. The crisis peaked with a snap general election in 2022, leading to the formation of a new coalition government. Key events like the Sheraton Move, which saw the fall of the Pakatan Harapan government and the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, epitomize the political volatility that this project aims to decipher.

## Data Sources
1. Wikipedia: Entries detailing Malaysian political parties and politicians, linked with election outcomes.
2. Thevesh Theva's Github: Thevesh's data on Malaysian parliamentary election results

## Goals
1. __Predicting Party-Switching Likelihood__: Determine the probability of Malaysian politicians switching political parties.
2. __Identifying Key Influencers__: Recognize politicians who significantly influence others to change parties, such as Azmin Ali's role in the defection of MPs from PKR to BERSATU.
3. __Forecasting Coalition Formations__: Analyze potential alliances between political parties, considering historical rivalries and recent collaborations.

## Methodology
The project employs a combination of statistical analysis, machine learning models, and network analysis to:

- Analyze historical voting patterns and political affiliations.
- Identify patterns in party-switching behavior.
- Model the influence of key political figures.
- Simulate potential future political alliances and coalition formations.
